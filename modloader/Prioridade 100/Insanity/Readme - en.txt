------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insanity in the state of San Andreas v1.0 for GTA San Andreas. This mod adds a large amount of madness in GTA San Andreas. 

To activate the modes of fashion, you need to enter the following cheat codes: 

IVVEXX – very fast machine, the speed of which you can see in the video that I put after the description of the mod. The car accelerated in different directions, not just right, press R. they have exploded. 

VOCWVA – over all San Andreas ω planes. New: spawn different types of aircraft, and now in really random places over the player(Previously only spawn Shamal, and only in one place). The airplanes tend to fall to the ground and fly high in the sky, occasionally falling. Also some allowed in CJ, and in the adjacent people's rockets. 


LVNWPG – apparently, pedestrians are so "burning" from the events of madness, they decide to leave the earth's orbit at its pukan. However, the force of gravity to overcome the fails and after some time they fall to the ground. 

GPMIDV – fall from the sky to pedestrians. It is not known where they come from, but most likely this is the aircraft passengers, drivers who had a feeding completely. 

NJCEVX – your car can travel long distances in an explosion that appears under the wheels, if you press lctrl. That's just from the explosion damaged all around, but you and your machine. 

It is recommended to play with the mod in the first person.
