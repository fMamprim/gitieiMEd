Features

If you are on foot, can press G (or group control forward) to enter a car as a passenger.

If you are already in a car and want the autodriver and driveby to work, press Y (conversation yes) to enable it.

You can driveby by pressing horn + yes (H + Y) while in car and horn + no (H + N) to stop drivebying. (to drive by a weapon of your choice, before you enter the car, choose your weapon first)

You can change the car's speed after typing in a command ("DF") with your accelerate button, brake button and hand break button.

You can make the car drive around the paths crazy by typing "DAF" or normally "DAX".

You can create a target on the map and type "DF" or "DX" for the car to drive to the target.

You can teleport to the target at a random price by typing "TS". (will not work in SA:MP for anti cheating purposes)

You can follow another nearby car by typing "FOLO".

All of these will work in SA:MP bug free! (will not show messages however)


CLEO3 stuff
Instead of typing the commands (ex. "DAF"), hold them (so hold "DAF" instead).
The variable displayer is broken. (displaying your speed is broken)
Instead of "DF" or "DX" its "DC" or "DV".
The "followcar" will not work for CLEO3
