                Mission Coding with Sanny Builder Tutorial

                Part II

                Coding Basics

                

                

                
		   
                

                

                

                

                

                

                 ** Introduction **
                 

                

                Hi, in Part II we will get some basics of coding, create
                spheres, actors, cars, markers, texts, panels etc....

                

                If you need to look at Part I it's [here](articles11.htm).

                

                As in [Part I](articles11.htm), I recommend you to print the
                topic using Printable Version of Topic, by clicking **print
                this topic** on top right of the first message.

                

                

                

                A lot of examples here use globals (variables that start with
                a $ like : $markerxx ,
                $car00 , $actor00 , $myweaps00 ) but it doesn't
                mean you cannot use locals (varaiables that end with a @ like
                : 0@ , 1@ , 28@ , 1004@ ). I use gobals so I
                can name them for easier understading. But when you'll be
                coding you should use locals, for many reasons they are
                better. You only need to use gloabls when you need the
                varaible in two (or more) different threads (it's pretty
                rare, and it isn't usually much more than a few varaible).

                

                

                

                Often I will give a four digit hexadecimal number (like 0103,
                02a8, 00ec, 032b, etc...) they're opcodes, to have a
                description write the four digit number on a new line in
                Sanny Builder and press F1.

                

                

                Most examples are given in a CODE tag like this :

 **CODE **

CODE tag

                

                So you can copy and past it in Sanny, I recommand you to do
                so often, it will help you understanding. And you won't have
                to write the opcode number and press F1 everytime.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                 ** 1. Using Sanny : **
                 

                

                This part is most repeat parts of [Sanny's Help](hotkeys.htm) but
                sometimes explained differently. But you can still report to
                the [Hotkeys page](hotkeys.htm) for more details.

                

                Hotkeys : 

                

                

                - 
                 F1
                 : the magic hotkey !!!!! write an opcode like 004F and press
                F1 and ho magic appears :

                

**CODE **

004F: create_thread @ODDVE

                or write thread and press it and press it again, Sanny will
                suggest you all those different lines :

**CODE **

004E: end_thread

004F: create_thread @ODDVEH

00D7: create_thread_with_wasted_busted_check @NONAME_2

03A4: name_thread 'MAIN'

0459: end_thread_named 'INT'

004F: create_thread @ODDVEH
                

                

                F1 will be the key you'll use a lot, just think about what
                you want (car, actor, checkpoint, markers, weapon, money,
                paintjob, etc...) write it and press F1. It won't do what you
                want everytime but it will get you going. 

                F1 is kind of google for Sanny !!!!!!!

                

                But notice that it only works for one and only one word. 

                

                Remember (or learn if you didn't know) that F1 gets it's
                suggestions from opcodes.txt so make sure you did what it's
                in part II introduction.

                

                - 
                 Ctrl + Shift +

                 Ctrl +

                gosub or jf -jump_if_false-)and press it the editor will
                bring you the the label. Look animation to see that I've
                place on @PSAVE1_1498 and
                it bring me to the label it self :PSAVE1_1498 .

                 Ctrl + T
                 : delete word, remember things like end_thread will be
                considered as one word.

                 Ctrl + Y
                 : delete line

                

                - 
                 Ctrl + Shift +
                Y
                 : clear line, leave the line but delete what's written in
                it.

                 : comment out the line your cursor is (adds // at begining

                 Ctrl + G
                 : go to line

                

                - 
                 Ctrl + R

                 : copy 

                

                - 
                 Ctrl + V
                 : paste

                

                - 
                 F7
                 : compile and copy to GTA SA folder main.scm and
                script.img

                

                

                

                

                

                Editor completion : 

                

                Sanny can complete some thing for you like global variables,
                labels, model IDs, to use it just write first character ($,
                @, or #) and get what you need. Look the animation I think it
                explains well : 

                

                

                Those are the most used exemples, but you might find many use
                for this tool.

                

                Notice that with models, the nudel number is shown, so it's a
                pretty easy way to find what number a model is.

                

                

                

                

                Coords Manager : 

                

                Very usefull tool here which get the 3D position of the
                player. Of course the game muste be running....

                

                The 3 dimension position is the value of each axis (x, y, z).
                The San Andreas map goes from -3000.0 to 3000.0 on x and y axis. The
                altitude (z) max of planes is about 800.0 units. Axis x is
                oriented west east, the x value increases when going east.
                Axis y is oriented south north, the y value increases when
                going north. Center of the map is located at 0.0 0.0 0.0 .

                Well it looks like that : 

                

                This screenshot is from old Sanny Builder new coord manager
                is slightly different.

                

                

                **Copy** will copy into clipboard the 3d pos like 747.756 -1809.0986 13.0234 

                

                **Read** will refresh the position of the player
                ingame.

                

                **Set** will put player at the position you've written in
                the three dimensions.

                

                

                In new Sanny Builder you get the Z angle value. This is the
                value of the angle around z axis which means what direction
                the player (CJ) is looking at. 0.0 is north, 180.0 is south,
                90.0 is east, 270.0 is west.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                
                 ** 2. Adding mission mods : **
                 

                

                This isn't really coding but it is usefull for everyone to
                look/test/use/imitate parts of other's mods. 

                

                First thing to know when adding mods : FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS
                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Every mods is different so when adding a
                mod first follow the author instructions to add it, they're
                the best instructions. But sometimes there isn't much
                instruction.

                

                Then, most of mods are main part (look part I, 1.Main.scm
                architecture) mods. So they're activated (create_thread) and
                executed in the main part. You probably want to add mods to
                original main.scm (or modded main.scm), then you'll will use
                004F (create_thread) here :

**CODE **

004F: create_thread @ODDVEH
004F: create_thread @R3
004F: create_thread @GYM
004F: create_thread @SHOOT
004F: create_thread @BLOODR
004F: create_thread @HOTR
004F: create_thread @KICKS
004F: create_thread @PSAVE1
004F: create_thread @FLOW
004F: create_thread @HELP
004F: create_thread @COLLS
004F: create_thread @CRANES
004F: create_thread @BUY_PRO
004F: create_thread @VALET_L
004F: create_thread @ADPLANE
Between any of those lines you'll add :

**CODE **

004F: create_thread @modlabel
                 where it will be of course the mod's first label name
                instead of modlabel.

                

                Then you've got the mod itself, you have to add it anywhere
                in main part. BUT it isn't really anywhere, it's more like
                anywhere after it's been created/activated, and not inside
                another thread. to simplify just put it at the very end of
                main part, so before : 

**CODE **

//-------------Mission 0---------------
// Originally: Initial 1
                

                

                

                Then compile and copy to San Andreas data\script (F7), launch
                the game, start a new game and.....

                

                

                

                have fun 

                

                

                

                

                Hang on, if it really did work, you're like really very very
                lucky (and you did a good job apparently) !!!! Most of time
                first try simply doesn't work. So watch what you've done,
                look how the author of the mod did it, watch global variables
                (if only numbers you should change it to a custom name), the
                try again, and if you really can't get it working, ask the
                author how he did (do that after several tries and checks,
                don't disturb the author for a mistake you've done).

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                
                 ** 3. Weapon pickups and parked cars : **
                 

                

                For me this part isn't real coding neither but it's usefull
                and asked very very very often, and it's a good opportunity
                to explain how it works.

                

                Pickups and parked car are spaecial opcode because it telle
                the engine to create such car or such weapon if player is
                close enough to the point.

                

                Well I'll take exemple to the cars/vehicles that you always
                find in one place (the skimmer near the dam, the AT400 at
                Vegas airport, the cropduster in the desert, these are the
                only one I can think of right now) everytime (actually not
                everytime) you come back it's here. Same for weapons (the
                heatseek rockets at the abandonned village, the gun behind
                Sweet's house...), life (red heart in gang wars), and
                armor.

                

                

                

                

                

                Parked cars : 

**CODE **

014B: $mycarx00 = init_parked_car_generator #CHEETAH 15 15 1 alarm 0 door_lock 0 0 0 at -1253.1 -348.0 13.9 angle 0.0
014C: set_parked_car_generator $mycarx00 cars_to_generate_to 101

                

                

                

                - This will create a cheetah (**#CHEETAH **) 

                

                - at the 3d coordinate -1253.1
                -348.0 13.9 

                

                - the car will be headed the z_angle 219.0 (z_angle is the angle
                around the axis z, 0.0 and 360.0 is north, 180.0 is south, 90.0 is east, 270.0 is west), so this car is
                

                directed to south-west

                

                - with color one number 15 (you can notice sometimes
                -1 which mean any)

                

                - with color two number 15 (you can notice sometimes
                -1 which mean any)

                

                - Car belongs to the player (the cops don't think you've
                stole it) becasue next parameters is set to 1 . If would set on 0 cops will give you a wanted
                level when you enter it

                

                - Without alarm, because it's 0 . It's actaully percentage
                of chances of getting alarm. So if you want the alarm to go
                off everytime set it to 100 , if you want it once out
                of two time then 50
                etc....

                

                - Doors won't be lock. As you can read door_lock is set to
                0 . If 1 doors will be lock. The two
                others parameters are unknown.

                

                - This car generation (not the car itself) is set as handle
                $mycarx00 

                

                

                And you should be wondering how do I know all that (beside
                simply reading and thinking) ???????

                Well go check [http://sa-db.webtools4you.net/](http://sa-db.webtools4you.net/" target="_blank), clic go
                without writting anything, and with your internet browser (if
                you don't know what it is then it's Internet Explorer) go
                Edition\Find in the page, and search for 014B.

                

                You'll then get [014B description](http://sa-db.webtools4you.net/?show=all&mark=014b#014b" target="_blank).
Wait till your internet browser brings you to 014 description (4 or 5
seconds), and it will be at top of th page highlighted in yellow. 

                

                

                The line after 014C just activates or unactivate the parked
                car generator for this car generation handle : 101 makes it spawn and 0 doesn't. It is needed don't
                forget one for each car generation, but they don't have to be
                together you can separate them.

                

                

                There is other types of parked cars they're very close to
                this one and they ain't much usefull.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                Weapon pickups : 

                

                There is two types of weapons pickups, one for weapons which
                doesn't need ammunitions (like dildos, katana, golf club,
                shovel, parachute....), and is actualy just a normal
                pickup.

                

                Those both pickup opcodes like with parked cars opcode don't
                need to request and load the model before using. 
                
- Melee (and gift) weapons

                    **CODE **

0213: $myweaps00 = create_pickup #CHNSAW       type 15 at -2083.0 298.0 42.0
0213: $myweaps01 = create_pickup #BAT          type 15 at -2306.0  93.0 35.0
0213: $myweaps02 = create_pickup #SHOVEL       type 15 at -2796.4 123.6  6.8
0213: $myweaps03 = create_pickup #POOLCUE      type 15 at -2135.0 197.0 35.0
0213: $myweaps04 = create_pickup #KATANA       type 15 at -2208.0 696.0 50.0
0213: $myweaps05 = create_pickup #BRASSKNUCKLE type 15 at -2206.0 961.0 80.0

                    

                    

                    You can use this opcode for other pickups like the
                    keycard (what you get with the croupier girl- model :
                    **#KEYCARD **),
                    armour (model : **#BODYARMOUR **), life
                    (model : **#HEALTH
                    **), bribe (model : **#BRIBE **), save disks
                    (only the pickup not the saving routine ! - model :
                    **#PICKUPSAVE **),
                    briefcase (model : **#BRIEFCASE **) etc...

                    

                    All the melee weapons (including parachute -**#PARA_PACK **- but not
                    the goggles), and health, armour, bribes, are hardcoded
                    that mean you don't have to check if the player picks up
                    the so-called pickup, just go to the pickup and it
                    automaticly gives the weapon/bribe/armour/health
                    etc....

                    

                    

                    For keycard, save disk, briefcase, but as well as all
                    define objects models (if there ain't too big of course)
                    because they can be use as a pickup, you have to check if
                    the pickup has been pickup or not. You don't have to
                    destroy it once it's been picked, because as soon as the
                    player is on it it will automaticly disappear.

                    For this you must use something like this :

**CODE **

00D6: if
0214: pickup $pickupvar picked_up
004D: jump_if_false @

                    

                    

                    

                  
                  
- Firearms (and all others)

                    But for weapons which have ammunition, with an exeption
                    for the night and infrared goggles, (models : **#NVGOGGLES **, and
                    **#IRGOGGLES **)
                    you'll need to use the pickups which give ammunition with
                    the weapon (doesn't it sound obvious ?) :

                    

**CODE **

032B: $myweaps06 = create_weapon_pickup #NVGOGGLES 15 ammo 1   at   299.5   -31.7 1001.0
032B: $myweaps07 = create_weapon_pickup #IRGOGGLES 15 ammo 1   at   299.6   -41.3 1001.0

032B: $myweaps15 = create_weapon_pickup #GRENADE   15 ammo 20  at -2035.4   137.2   28.3
032B: $myweaps16 = create_weapon_pickup #AK47      15 ammo 120 at  2499.3 -1707.4 1014.2
032B: $myweaps17 = create_weapon_pickup #TEC9      15 ammo 120 at  2499.5 -1709.6 1014.2
032B: $myweaps18 = create_weapon_pickup #SAWNOFF   15 ammo 60  at  2493.4 -1708.2 1014.9
032B: $myweaps19 = create_weapon_pickup #MOLOTOV   15 ammo 20  at  2493.5 -1706.8 1015.1
032B: $myweaps22 = create_weapon_pickup #COLT45    15 ammo 100 at  -365.4 -1422.4   25.5
032B: $myweaps23 = create_weapon_pickup #FLAME     15 ammo 200 at  -366.0 -1418.6   25.5

                    

                    

                    Well for those ones, the number after 
                     ammo is the number
                    of ammunition you'll have when you pick the weapon
                  up.
                
                For all pickups (both 0213 and 032B) :

                

                type 1 disables the
                pickup (you can't pick it up)

                type 3 make the pickup
                pickable only one time 

                type 15 make the pickup
                re-grows up everytime after you picked it up (probably what
                you want)

                

                

                the three floats are the coordinates of the pickup like those
                :-366.0 -1418.6 25.5
                

                

                $myweapsxx is the
                handle of the pickup, the variable that contains it.

                

                and **#GRENADE ** is
                the model.

                

                One last thing is that you can find a weapon list [right here](SCMHELPGTASA14.htm).

                

                There is some weapons like the jetpack, or the parachute
                where you can use either 0213 or 032B with ammo 1 it has the
                same result.

                

                

                You can destroy pickups before it's been pickup, with 0215
                :

**CODE **

0215: destroy_pickup $myweaps01
                

                

                

                

                

                
                 ** 4. Threads : **
                 

                

                There isn't much to say more than what's been told in [Part I : 4. Threads and labels](articles11.htm#4thredlab). 

                

                Just that you create them with 004F like that :

**CODE **

004F: create_thread @name_of_your_thread
                

                

                You name it with 03A4 :

**CODE **

03A4: name_thread 'NAME'
                No more than 7 letter.

                

                

                You can end it with 004E from the thread itself :

**CODE **

004E: end_thread
                

                

                Or from anywhere else with 0459 :

**CODE **

0459: end_thread_named 'NAME'
                

                

                

                

                Sometime you can find weird 004F like :

                

                

                

                Don't worry it's just how you can set local variable for the
                thread you create. Like on the example $ACTOR_RYDER will be 0@ , 0 (first one) will be 1@ , 0 (second one) will be 2@ , 2 will be 3@ , 1 will be 4@ in the thread :AUDIOL .

                

                Like Sanny tells you you can set up to 32 locals there for
                the thread you create from 0@ to 31@ . It can be very usefull
                but if you don't really understend it doesn't really matter,
                it's just so you know about it. 

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                 ** 5. Spheres and markers : **
                

                

                

                Spheres : 

                A sphere (also called POI cylinder) is the red round thingy
                that you walk in when you start a mission. 

                

                Even if you don't actually see the red circle, the game (and
                you while modding) uses many sphere all the time. Just to
                check if actor x is near a given coordinate within a certain
                radius.

                

                To create thoses special spheres that checks if actor is near
                it you need a special type of opcodes that have a command and
                are conditional !!!! There rare but so usefull since GTA III.
                They are conditional because they check if the actor
                is near it and in the meanwhile they display the red sphere
                ingame.

        These opcodes are good use them !!!
                
                For all of them opcodes :

                

                Where ever it is placed the integer 0 or 1 tells the engine to show the
                red circle (1=show;0=don't show). 

                

                The first 2 or 3 (2 for 2D, 3 for 3D) floats like -366.066 -1418.683 25.5 are
                the position.

                

                The second 2 or 3 (2 for 2D, 3 for 3D) floats like 4.0 4.0 6.0 are the radius of
                the sphere.

                

                $PLAYER_ACTOR or 71@ , are the actor
                variables. 

                

                

                To have the sphere working (and then appearing) you need to
                place it in a loop :

                

**CODE **

:SPHERE_LOOP
0001: wait 0 ms
00D6: if
00EC: actor $PLAYER_ACTOR 0 near_point 1812.369 -1929.9215 radius 80.0 80.0
004D: jump_if_false @SPHERE_LOOP
                

                

                The thread must be running on the loop for the condition to
                checked, and for the red circle to appear. The wait is needed
                don't make it too long otherwise it will be flickering, keep
                to 0 ms to have it nice.

                

                

                

                Markers :  
                
                  
- Marker icons

                    Markers icons are the radar assets you go to to do a
                    mission. Like , , or , etc...

                    

                    Thanks to LazioFreak for finding them. You can find a
                    list of the icons and the numbers to use them on this
                    page [[SA] radar icons](http://www.lzfdownloads.de/index2.php?page=46&action=text" target="_blank) or in [Sanny Builder's
                    Help contents in SCM Documentation: GTA SA: radar
                    icons*](SCMHELPGTASA9.htm).

                    

                    

                    There is four opcodes to create them :

                    

                    Three without sphere (like it's said in the opcode
                    description) 04ce and 0570 :

**CODE **
*

04CE: $marker01 = create_icon_marker_without_sphere 12 at 2447.3643 -1974.4963 12.5469
0570: $marker02 = create_asset_radar_marker_with_icon 36 at 1837.3643 -1974.4963 12.5469
02A8: $marker03 = create_marker 23 at 658.0068 -1866.3127 4.4537

                    

                    02a8 will ALWAYS be visible on the radar.

                    

                    

                    One with a sphere 02a7 :

**CODE **

02A7: $marker00 = create_icon_marker_and_sphere 33 at 2514.5601 -1666.84 13.38

                    

                    Like 02a8, this one is pretty cool because it will be
                    ALWAYS visible on the radar, where ever you go you'll see
                    it.

                    But watch out it's only a sphere (just the red circle) it
                    doesn't check if the player is near it, just the radar
                    marker and the sphere. To check if the player is near it
                    use opcodes told upper in spheres.

                    

                    All of them are 5 parameters opcodes : 
                    
                      $markerxx is
                        the handle of the marker
                      
- The integer like 12 , 36 , or 23 are the marker
                        icons number you can find on [SCM Documentation: GTA SA: radar
                    icons*](SCMHELPGTASA9.htm)
                      
- The three floats are the x y z coordinates
                    
                  
                  
- Color markers

                    The color markers are that :

                   *

                    

                    And on the radar they are represented by a colored square
                    like that :

                    

                    

                    

                    

                    To create them on vehicle/actor/object/pickup :

**CODE **

0186: $marker04 = create_marker_above_car $car00
0187: $marker05 = create_marker_above_actor $actor00
0188: $marker06 = create_marker_above_object $object00
03DC: $marker07 = create_marker_above_pickup $myweaps00

                    

                    Watch out the vehicle/actor/object/pickup must be
                    existing and store in the hanlde otherwise you'll crash
                    the game.

                    With 03dc, the marker over the pickup will always be
                    green what ever you do with it. 
                    
                      $markerxx is
                        the handle of the marker
                      
- $car00 ,
                        $actor00  ,
                        $object00 ,
                        $myweaps00 are
                        the handles of vehicle/actor/object/pickup
                    
                    You can change the color of the marker with :

**CODE **

0165: set_marker $marker05 color_to 1

                    
                      
- 0 = red
                      
- 1 = green
                      
- 2 = light
                      blue
                      
- 3 = white
                      
- 4 = light
                      yelow
                    
                    With 0168 you can change the size of the marker (unlike
                    the description says) :

**CODE **

0168: show_on_radar $marker04 1

                    
                      
- < 3 :
                        smaller the default size
                      
- = 3 : default
                        size
                      
- > 3 :
                      bigger
                    
                    You can set to enemy or friendly color (it only change
                    the color):

**CODE **

07E0: set_marker $marker02 type_to 1

                    
                      
- 0 : enemy
                      red
                      
- 1 : friendly
                        blue
                    
                  
                
                To hide and show them (both icons and colored markers) :

**CODE **

018B: show_on_radar $marker04 1
                
                  
- 0 = hide
                  
- 1 = hide
                  
- 2 = show
                  
- 3 = show
                  
- 4 = hide
                  
- 5 = hide
                
                To destroy them (both icons an colored markers) :

**CODE **

0164: disable_marker $markerxx
                

                Where of course $markerxx is the handle of
                the marker.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                
                 ** 6. Actors, weapons and vehicles : **
                 

                

                Now let's create some things to destroy them !!!!!

                

                

                First when you create actors, vehicles, objects, or give
                weapons to an actor, you have to load the models and check
                they are loaded before creating them. 

                

                So you need to request the models with 0247 :

**CODE **

0247: request_model #CHEETAH
0247: request_model #DESERT_EAGLE
                

                

                then load requested models with 038b :

**CODE **

038B: load_requested_models
                

                

                

                After you need a check to confirm that the models are really
                loaded (available for the engine to use):

**CODE **

00D6: if and
0248: model #HEATSEEK available
0248: model #DESERT_EAGLE available
0248: model #MP5LNG available
0248: model #CR_AMMOBOX available
0248: model #CHEETAH available
0248: model #WFYSEX available
004D: jump_if_false @LOOP_RQ_10
                

                

                The jump if false jumps to :LOOP_RQ_10 where the model
                will be requested again loaded again.

                

                All in one it look like that :

**CODE **

:LOOP_RQ_10
0001: wait 0
0247: request_model #WFYSEX
0247: request_model #CR_AMMOBOX
0247: request_model #CHEETAH
0247: request_model #DESERT_EAGLE
0247: request_model #MP5LNG
0247: request_model #HEATSEEK
038B: load_requested_models
00D6: if and
0248: model #HEATSEEK available
0248: model #DESERT_EAGLE available
0248: model #MP5LNG available
0248: model #CR_AMMOBOX available
0248: model #CHEETAH available
0248: model #WFYSEX available
004D: jump_if_false @LOOP_RQ_10
                

                

                Notice the wait because it's very important here you do a
                loop, you make the engine comes back to where it was before.
                You need this wait, wait 0 ms is far enough, you don't need
                more, but you DO need it.

                

                

                Now that the models are available you can create your
                actors/vehicles/objects, and give weapons to the actors :

                

**CODE **

00A5: $car00 = create_car #CHEETAH at 2368.5601 -1666.84 13.38
009A: $actor00 = create_actor 22 #WFYSEX at 2490.56 -1666.84 14.38
009A: $actor01 = create_actor 22 #WFYSEX at 2495.56 -1666.84 14.38
009A: $actor02 = create_actor 22 #WFYSEX at 2490.56 -1660.84 14.38
009A: $actor03 = create_actor 22 #WFYSEX at 2495.56 -1660.84 14.38
0107: $object00 = create_object #CR_AMMOBOX at 2502.5601 -1566.84 24.38
01B2: give_actor $actor00 weapon 36 ammo 900 // Load the weapon model before using this
01B2: give_actor $actor01 weapon 29 ammo 900 // Load the weapon model before using this
01B2: give_actor $actor02 weapon 24 ammo 300 // Load the weapon model before using this
01B2: give_actor $actor03 weapon 29 ammo 900 // Load the weapon model before using this

                                                                                                                                   
                  
- For creating a car with 00a5 : 
                    
                      $car00 is
                        the car handle
                      
- **#CHEETAH
                        ** is the model. Use editor completion to have a
                        list of models (watch out there is ALL models, cars,
                        actors, objects).
                      
- 2490.56 -1666.84
                        14.38 are the coordinates.
                    
                  
                  
- Create actor with 009a : 
                    
                      $actor00 is
                        the actor handle
                      
- **#WFYSEX **
                        is the model. Use editor completion to have a list of
                        models.
                      
- The integer 22
                        is the ped type. The ped type is the temper, the way
                        the actor will act by default (without any order
                        given). You can find a list of ped types in Sanny
                        Builder help contents in SCM Documentation: GTA
                        SA: PedTypes*. Here they don't like cops and will
                        defend themself if they're attacked, among other
                        things.
                      
- 2368.5601 -1666.84
                        13.38 are the coordinates.
                    
                  
                  
- 0107 will create an object : 
                    
                      $object00 is
                        the object handle
                      
- **#CR_AMMOBOX
                        ** is the model. Here you can use any objects
                        defined in the map files (.ide files in GTA San
                        Andreas\data\maps folder) as long as you defined the
                        object in define object section in the scm. See [Part I : 1. Main.scm
                      architecture](articles11.htm#1scmarchi).
                      
- 2502.5601 -1566.84
                        24.38 are the coordinates.
                    
                  
                  
- Finally 01b2 gives an actor a weapon : 
                    
                      $actor00 is
                        the actor handle
                      
- The first integer 36 , 29 or 24 after weapon is the
                        Weapon number. You can find a list of weapons their
                        numbers and the correponding model in Sanny Builder
                        help contents in *SCM Documentation: GTA SA: Weapon
                        numbers*.
                      
- The second integer 300 or 900 after ammo is the
                        number of ammunition given to the actor along with
                        it's weapon. Here it's too much depends of how time
                        the actor will live but I found that 150 is usualy
                        far enough.
                    
                    Even if you might think that this opcode don't need the
                    weapon model to be loaded, but it DO NEEDS the model to
                    be loaded. To ensure you can look at the comment (after
                    //) which says : "// Load
                    the weapon model before using this "
                
                Now they're ready to shoot away but they'll have to wait a
                bit !!!!

                

                

                

                

                You might need to change the direction of the car (z angle),
                or its colors (there is up to four colors for cars) :

**CODE **
*

0175: set_car $car00 z_angle_to 90.0
0229: set_car $car00 color_to 11 0
0A11: set_car $car00 tertiary_color_to 6 quaternary_color_to 12
                

                

                It's pretty easy so I'll be fast : 
                
                  
- for all of them $car00 is the car handle
                    as usual !!!!
                  
- In 0175 the float 90.0 is the z angle from
                    -360.0 to 360.0 .
                  
- In 0229 the integers 11 is the primary color
                    and 0 is the
                    secondary color.
                  
- In 0a11 the integers 6 is the tertiary color
                    and 12 is the
                    quaternary color. Don't worry about the opcode
                    description, by the time the sascm.ini used here (the one
                    given with Sanny) was written the opcode wasn't known
                    yet, but it will still work very well, and now that you
                    know what the opcode does, there is nothing to stop you
                    !!!
                
                For infos, those were only "set" opcodes, but there is
                opposite opcodes for all thoses "get" opcodes. The "get"
                opcodes will get the color/angle of the car and stores it in
                variables :

                

**CODE **

0174: $carangle = car $car00 z_angle
03F3: get_car $car00 color $primcolor $scndcolor
0A12: get_car $car00 tertiary_color_to $tertcolor quaternary_color_to $quatcolor

                

                

                Well, what can I say, it the same as before but the all way
                around, instead of saying the engine to put a color on the
                car or put the car in such direction, it finds what color the
                car is or what direction the car is and put the resulting
                integer in the variable. 

                The variable names should speak form themselves.

                

                

                As much obvious as it is, you can't change the color of an
                actor !!!!!! But you can change the direction (s)he's looking
                at, and know where (s)he's looking :

**CODE **

0172: $actorangle = actor $actor00 z_angle
0173: set_actor $actor00 z_angle_to 262.0

                

                

                Same for objects, here is just the angle, but there is more
                on objects just next :

**CODE **

0176: $objangle = object $object00 z_angle
0177: set_object $object00 z_angle_to 180.0
                

                

                

                

                When you finished using those actor/vehicles/object you have
                two different ways to get rid of them : 
                
                  
- First you can simply destroy them (they will just
                    disappear straight away) :

**CODE **

00A6: destroy_car $car00
0108: destroy_object $object00
009B: destroy_actor_instantly $actor01
034F: destroy_actor_with_fade $actor00 // The actor fades away like a ghost

                    

                    034f as the comment says "// The actor fades away like a
                    ghost ". Is usualy what you see happening in
                    original game when an actor is dead, it slowly
                    disappear.

                  
                  
- Secondly you can remove references from them, this will
                    turn them into normal peds (just like every
                    pedestrian/vehicle you see ingame). So the
                    actor/vehicle/object will still be there but the handle
                    $car00 /$actor00  /$object00 won't hold the
                    actor/vehicle/object anymore :

**CODE **

01C2: remove_references_to_actor $actor00 // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian
01C3: remove_references_to_car $car00 // Like turning a car into any random car
01C4: remove_references_to_object $object00 //This object will now disappear when the player looks away

                    

                    The comments (after //) explain what the opcodes do
                    pretty well again.
                
                Now that the actors/vehicles/objects are destroyed the engine
                don't need the models any more. So to free some game memory
                you can release the models with 0249 :

**CODE **

0249: release_model #WFYSEX
0249: release_model #CR_AMMOBOX
0249: release_model #CHEETAH
0249: release_model #DESERT_EAGLE
0249: release_model #MP5LNG
0249: release_model #HEATSEEK
                

                

                

                

                

                **About special actors :**

                

                Actors like Ryder, BigSmoke, Sweet, Tenpeny, Pulaski, Toreno,
                Ceasar, Jethro etc... are called special actors, they're not
                like the usual ped you find on the street. Then, in scm
                coding, they're handled in a special way, with special
                opcodes those so special actors !!!! 

                

                It goes like this :

**CODE **

023C: request_special_actor 'TENPEN' as 1
023C: request_special_actor 'PULASKI' as 2
023C: request_special_actor 'HERN' as 3
023C: request_special_actor 'CESAR' as 4
023C: request_special_actor 'JETHRO' as 5
023C: request_special_actor 'MADDOGG' as 6
                
        
                

                Here you have requested the models 'TENPEN' , 'PULASKI' and 'HERN' and define them as
                special actor models integers 1 , 2 and 3 .

                You can find a special actor list in Sanny Builder help
                contents in SCM Documentation: GTA SA: Special actors*.
                You can only define 9 special actor models at the same time
                (integers from 1 to
                10 included).

                

                

                Then you have to check if the special actors are loaded and
                create them either on foot or in a car with the usual
                create_actor opcodes :

**CODE **
*

wait 0
00D6: if and
023D:  special_actor 1 loaded
023D:  special_actor 2 loaded
023D:  special_actor 3 loaded
023D:  special_actor 4 loaded
023D:  special_actor 5 loaded
023D:  special_actor 6 loaded
0248:  model #COPCARLA available                  
004D: jump_if_false @check_1
00A5: 0@ = create_car #COPCARLA at 2431.609 -1254.061 22.8303
01C8: 1@ = create_actor 23 #SPECIAL01 in_car 0@ passenger_seat 0
0129: 2@ = create_actor 23 #SPECIAL02 in_car 0@ driverseat
01C8: 3@ = create_actor 23 #SPECIAL03 in_car 0@ passenger_seat 1
009A: 4@ = create_actor 23 #SPECIAL04 at 2436.609 -1254.061 22.8303
009A: 5@ = create_actor 23 #SPECIAL05 at 2437.609 -1254.061 22.8303
009A: 6@ = create_actor 23 #SPECIAL06 at 2438.609 -1254.061 22.8303
                
                                                                           
                

                When creating actors, see how the model is named **#SPECIAL01 ** and that it
                refers to the integer used in 023c(request_special_actor).
                Then special actors models are named from **#SPECIAL01 ** to **#SPECIAL10 **.

                

                If you need other special actors later (like in another
                mission) follow the same procedure with different models
                names but keeping 1 ,
                2 and 3 as special actor model
                integer, like :

**CODE **

023C: request_special_actor 'SMOKE' as 1
023C: request_special_actor 'TORINO' as 2
023C: request_special_actor 'SWEET' as 3
023C: request_special_actor 'TRUTH' as 4
023C: request_special_actor 'CESAR' as 5
023C: request_special_actor 'MADDOGG' as 6
023C: request_special_actor 'ZERO' as 4                                   
                

                

                To release the model simply use 0296 with the special actor
                integer model, and destroy the actor with usual 009b, 034f or
                01c2 :

**CODE **

0296: unload_special_actor 1
0296: unload_special_actor 2
0296: unload_special_actor 3
0296: unload_special_actor 4
0296: unload_special_actor 5
0296: unload_special_actor 6
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 0@
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 1@
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 2@
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 4@
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 5@
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 6@
00A6: destroy_car 3@
                
         
                

                

                

                
                 ** 7. Objects and moving them : **
                 

                

                In Grand Theft Auto San Andreas there is many many things you
                can do with objects, but I won't (and I can't) tell you
                everything about it. I'll give you far enough to do nice and
                fun things with them.

                

                I won't repeat (even if I do repeat a lot of things) how to
                request and load models to create objects, it's told upper. I
                won't repeat neither how to destroy/remove references and
                release objects for the same reason.

                

                

                

                First some general (general because there is similar opcodes
                for vehicles and actors) things about coordinates and
                offsets. Sometime you need to know where the object is
                placed, and sometimes you need to know what are the
                coordinates just a bit away from the object (this is called
                an offset) :

**CODE **

01BB: store_object $object00 position_to $objpos_x $objpos_y $objpos_z

0400: create_coordinate $objpos_x $objpos_y $objpos_z from_object $object00 offset 1.0 2.0 3.0
                
                  
- 01bb will simply get the object $object00 x y z
                    coordinates and store them into $objpos_x $objpos_y
                    $objpos_z .
                  
- In 0400 it will store the coordinates at the offsets
                    1.0 2.0 3.0 of the
                    object. It means that the coordinates that will be stored
                    in $objpos_x $objpos_y
                    $objpos_z will be 1.0 unit away from the
                    object on the object's z axis, 2.0 unit away from the
                    object on the object's y axis, and 3.0 unit away from the
                    object on the object's z axis.
                

                
                

                
                  
                    
                      As I
                        said there is similar opcodes for cars and actors,
                        the explaination is the same as before just replace
                        object by car or actor : 
                        
                          
- For vehicles :

**CODE **

00AA: store_car $car00 position_to $carpos_x $carpos_y $carpos_z
0407: create_coordinate $carpos_x $carpos_y $carpos_z from_car $car00 offset 1.0 2.0 3.0

                          
                          
- For actors :

**CODE **

00A0: store_actor $actor00 position_to $actorpos_x $actorpos_y $actorpos_z
04C4: create_coordinate $actorpos_x $actorpos_y $actorpos_z from_actor $actor00 offset 1.0 2.0 3.0

                          
                                            
                    
                  
                
                
                

                

                

                

                Once the object is created you can move the object to new
                coordinates :

**CODE **

01BC: put_object $object00 at 2368.5601 -1666.84 13.38
                

                For info similar opcodes for actors and cars are : 00a1 for
                actors and 00ab for cars.

                

                You can use this to make the object move along, it's isn't
                the best way to do it but it's simple and works well. Here is
                an example :

**CODE **

:MOVE_10
0001: wait 3 ms
00D6: if
0031:  0@ >= 200.0 // floating-point values
004D: jump_if_false @MOVEND
01BC: put_object $object00 at 0@ 1@ 2@
000B: 0@ += 0.1 // floating-point values
0002: jump @MOVE_10
                

                You can see here that the object will move along x axis, as
                every 3ms the object will go 0.1 distance unit further on
                the x axis until 0@
                (which is here the x axis unit) reaches 200.0 . DON'T FORGET THE WAIT
                !!!!!!

                

                

                The same way you can change the created object angles x y and
                z

**CODE **

0453: object $object00 set_rotation 0.0 0.0 180.0
                

                Same as 01bc with a little loop you can make the object turn
                around. And as for 01bc there is better ways to do it, but
                this one is simple and works well. It also as the advantage
                of giving you the possibility to change any angle x y or
                z.

                

                

                But you can as well use 034d so it will move around x axis :
                

**CODE **

034D: object $object00 at_angle 0.0 then_rotate_by_angle 360.0 flag 0
                

                This is how Rockstar open many garage doors (not all).

                

                But before using moving opcodes (like 034d or 0381) you need
                to give the object the ability to move (objects ain't able to
                move when you create them) :

**CODE **

0392: object $object00 toggle_in_moving_list 1
                
                  
- 0 = unable to
                  move
                  
- 1 = able to
                  move
                
                You can aswell throw the object (just like throwing a ball)
                with 0381 :

**CODE **

0381: throw_object $object00 distance 20.0 10.0 5.0
                
                  
- 20 is the distance
                    on x axis
                  
- 10 the distance on
                    y axis
                  
- 5 the distance on
                    z axis
                
                You can attach object to cars, actors or other objects :

**CODE **

0681: attach_object $object00 to_car $car00 at_offset 0.5 0.3 0.3 rotation 0.0 0.0 0.0
069B: attach_object $object00 to_actor $actor00 at_offset 0.0 0.5 -1.0 rotation 0.0 0.0 0.0
069A: attach_object $object00 to_object $object01 at_offset 0.0 0.0 0.0 rotation 0.0 0.0 0.0

                

                Those are pretty obvious, and as I already explained about
                offsets, so I'll just have to tell that the three floats
                after rotation are the x y and z angles that will be set, and
                that the object isn't solid whan attach to something else.

                

                

                If you don't want the object to be solid you can turn off the
                collision detection 

 **CODE **

0382: set_object $object00 collision_detection 0
                
                  
- 0 not solid
                  
- 1 solid
                
                You can make the object liftable like this :

                

                with 08e9 :

**CODE **

08E9: set_object $object00 liftable 1
                

                As usual 1 = on, 0 = off.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                This is a very very very cool thing (thanks to DexX and
                PLPynton) :

                

                You can attach object to body parts of the actor, actually
                you can attach 2 object to the actor and make the actor do an
                animation !!!!!!!

                There will be more on animation later, but I'll explain those
                now :

                

                

**CODE **

070A: AS_actor $PLAYER_ACTOR attach_to_object $object00 offset 0.0 0.0 0.0 on_bone 6 16 perform_animation "NULL" IFP_file "NULL" time 0

                

                attach the first object (object A)

                

                

**CODE **

09A0: actor $PLAYER_ACTOR attach_object $object01 with_offset 0.0 0.0 0.0 on_bone 5 16 perform_animation "NULL" IFP_file "NULL" time -1

                

                attach the second object (object B)

                

                For both of them : 
                
                  
- $PLAYER_ACTOR is
                    the actor handle (here it's you CJ)
                  
- the three floats 0.0 0.0
                    0.0 are the x y and z offsets from the normal bone
                    coordinates
                  
- the first integer 5 or 6 is the bone number (it's not the same as player body parts numbers for clothes)
                      0 - crashes
                        the game

                        the game
                    
                  
                  
- the second integer 16 is unknown and is
                    always 16 
                  
- the first long string "NULL" is the animation
                    file (more on them later, and IT HAS TO BE LOADED like
                    models) where the engine will get the animation. Here
                    "NULL" means that no
                    animation will be done.
                  
- the second long string "NULL" is the animation
                    itself within the animation file. Here "NULL" again means that no
                    animation will be done.
                  
- Last integer 0 ,
                    1 or -1 is unknown
                
                To take theses objects off you have two opcodes :

                

**CODE **

070B: set_actor $PLAYER_ACTOR onbone_attached_object_operation 1 // drop or detaches object B automatically with object A 
09A1: set_actor $PLAYER_ACTOR onbone_attached_objectB_operation 0 // drop or detaches object B only

                

                

                070b detaches/drops object A and B if object B attached

                09a1 detaches/drops object B 
                
                  
- $PLAYER_ACTOR is
                    still the actor handle (here it's you CJ)
                  
- the integer 1 or
                    0 tell if the object
                    will be droped of just been detach. 
                    
                      1 drops the
                        object
                      
- 0 detaches the
                        object
                    
                  
                
                **

                ** 

                
                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! watch out
                !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                Attach object A fisrt because otherwise object B won't
                appear. When you hold object A you can't get in a car and
                your weapon won't be visible. If you hold two objects, object
                B will drop when you fall or shoot with a weapon. If
                you die both objects will drop.
                

                

                

                

                

                As I said there is many things to do with objects in San
                Andreas but now you know the most important things you can
                do. 

                

                

                

                

                

                

                ** 8. Animations and particules : **
                 

                

                

                

                 **A.
                Animations :**
                 

                

                Lets get to something very important in GTA : The actors
                animations !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                The animations topic in SA in unending but as with objects we
                will see most important things.

                

                First lets say what are animation sequences, they are
                animations of an actor. Like when CJ is moving his arms while
                talking, when Ryder is smoking, when CJ is using the keycard,
                or when CJ is using the parachute...

                                

                More generally when an actor is making an action, when it's
                been animated* !!

                

                There is two types of animation sequences (AS), one which
                does one precise animation and another which make the
                animation you put as parameters in the opcode from the anims
                files (*.ifp in the anim.img file in anim folder of game
                directory). The second type need the animation to be loaded
                with 04ed, and as usual you need to check if the animation is
                loaded. 

                
                  **                  **
                
                  
- **First
                    type anims : one opcode does one animation**
                
                **                **

                

                some examples :

**CODE **
*

05BA: AS_actor $actor00 chew_gum 10000 ms
05BB: AS_actor $actor00 fall_down 0 time_on_ground 500
05BC: AS_actor $actor00 jump 1
05C5: AS_actor $actor00 cower 3000 ms
05C7: AS_actor $actor00 use_atm
05C8: AS_actor $actor00 look_around
05C9: AS_actor $actor00 on_guard 2000 ms
05CD: AS_actor $actor00 exit_car $car00
05D3: AS_actor $actor00 go_to 81.42 1474.63 51.56 speed 4 3000 ms
05D4: AS_actor $actor00 rotate_angle 77.0
0639: AS_actor $actor00 rotate_to_actor $actor01
0672: AS_actor $actor00 attack_car $car00
0673: AS_actor $actor00 dive_to_offset 1.0 -3.0 time_on_ground 1000 ms
0676: AS_actor $actor00 in_car $car00 move_from_passengerseat_to_driverseat
0677: AS_actor $actor00 chat_with_actor $actor02 1 1
06A9: AS_actor $actor00 look_at_point 681.81 -474.15 15.53 5000 ms
06E3: AS_actor $actor00 roll_sideways 1
                
                                  
                
                                
                

                They are the easiest to use, just put the opcode, the right
                parameters (the first is the actor which will do the
                animation ($actor00 ),
                then there are like said in the description either an angle
                (77.0 ), a 3D position
                (681.81 -474.15 15.53 ),
                a car ($car00 ),
                another actor ($actor01 ), the time the
                animation will last (5000 ) etc....

                They're easy simple and work very well don't hesitate to use
                a lot of them !!!!!!

                

                

                **                ** 
                
                  
- **Second
                    type anims : one opcode does the anim you have put as
                    parameters**
                
                **                **

                

                

                some examples :

**CODE **

0829: actor $actor00 perform_animation "CRCKDETH3" IFP_file "CRACK" 4.0 time 0 and_dies 
0605: actor $actor00 perform_animation_sequence "PASS_RIFLE_PED" IFP_file "MISC" 4.0 loop 0 0 0 0 time -1 // versionA
0812: AS_actor $actor00 perform_animation "LRGIRL_IDLELOOP" IFP_file "LOWRIDER" 4.0 loopA 0 lockX 0 lockY 0 lockF 0 time -1 // versionB
0A1A: actor $actor00 perform_animation "HIKER_POSE_L" IFP_file "MISC" 4.0 loopA 0 lockX 0 lockY 0 lockF 1 -1 ms // versionC
088A: actor $actor00 perform_animation "RAIL_FALL" IFP_file "SWAT" 8.0 loopA 0 lockX 0 lockY 0 lockF 1 limT -1 unknown 0 unknown 1 
070A: AS_actor $actor00 attach_to_object $object00 offset 0.0 0.0 0.0 on_bone 6 16 perform_animation "NULL" IFP_file "NULL" time 1 
09A0: actor $actor00 attach_object $object01 with_offset 0.0 0.0 0.0 on_bone 5 16 perform_animation "NULL" IFP_file "NULL" time -1
 

                

                

                Or with very good PLPynton's sascm.ini descriptions they look
                like this : 

**CODE **

0829: char $actor00 perform_animation "CRCKDETH3" group "CRACK" 4.0 limT 0 and_dies
0605: char $actor00 perform_animation "PASS_RIFLE_PED" group "MISC" 4.0 loopA 0 lockX 0 lockY 0 lockF 0 limT -1 //versionA
0812: char $actor00 perform_animation "EAT_VOMIT_P" group "FOOD" 4.0 loopA 0 lockX 0 lockY 0 lockF 0 limT -1 //versionB
0A1A: char $actor00 perform_animation "VEND_EAT1_P" group "VENDING" 4.0 loopA 0 lockX 0 lockY 0 lockF 0 limT -1 //versionC
088A: char $actor00 perform_animation "RAIL_FALL" group "SWAT" 8.0 loopA 0 lockX 0 lockY 0 lockF 1 limT -1 unknown 0 unknown 1
070A: set_char $actor00 attach_objectA $object00 with_offset 0.0 0.0 0.0 on_bone 6 16 perform_animation "NULL" group "NULL" time 1 //object no 1
09A0: set_char $actor00 attach_objectB $object00 with_offset 0.0 0.0 0.0 on_bone 5 16 perform_animation "NULL" group "NULL" time -1 //object no 2

                

                

                

                

                

                

                First for those you have to **load the animation**
                file before using the animation opcode. It's aesy, it's just
                like we requested car and actors models before :

**CODE **

:ANIMLOAD
0001: wait 0 ms
04ED: load_animation "FOOD"
00D6: if
04EE: animation "FOOD" loaded
004D: jump_if_false @ANIMLOAD
                

                

                As you have probably noticed it's just a bit diferent than
                with models, because here you directly load the anim, and
                with models, you request (with 0247) and then load the models
                (with 038b).

                

                Don't forget **after using it** to release the anim
                with

04EF: release_animation "LOWRIDER"
                

                

                

                Here to explain opcodes parameters I will use the PLPynton's
                sacsm.ini descriptions instead of using original Sanny
                Builder sascm.ini descriptions like I usually do, because it
                will be much easier for you to understand. But don't worry it
                is the same parameters order.

                

                Parameters (thanks ceedj): 
                
                  
- The first word between quotation marks is the animation
                    name ("CRCKDETH3" ,
                    "PASS_RIFLE_PED" ,
                    "HIKER_POSE_L" ,
                    etc...)
                  
- The second is the library (animation file) where the
                    anim is ("CRACK" ,
                    "SWAT" , "VENDING" , "FOOD" , etc...).

                    In some cases, like for 09a0 and 070a "NULL" means that no
                    animation will be done, they are both explained in
                    chapter 7.Objects and moving them*.
                  
- 4.0 is playback
                    rate. Default is 4.0, less than this slows it down, more
                    speeds it up and may skip animation frames with higher
                    numbers.
                  
- loopA or loop It's the Loop flag, to
                    make the animation start again once finished. 1 on/0 off, BUT if on,
                    Timelimit (parameter 8.) MUST be set to -1 .
                  
- lockX unlocks or
                    locks actor in position on X axis. If 1 and if the actor is
                    moving on the X axis from actor's origin (left to right),
                    he will stay at those new coords. If 0 , the actor will return
                    to the start position coords.
                  
- lockY unlocks or
                    locks actor in position on Y axis. If 1 and if the actor is
                    moving on the Y axis from actor's origin (front to back),
                    he will stay at those new coords. If 0 , the actor will return
                    to the start position coords.
                  
- lockF lock the
                    actor in final postion. If 1 it will play the
                    animation through once, then lock the actor into the
                    final frame of the animation. This can NOT be stopped
                    with opcode 0687 (clear_actor_task), but proceeding to
                    another animation will. 
                  
- limT the Timelimit
                    in milliseconds, is the time the actor will do the anim,
                    set to 1000 ms for 1
                    second, 6000 ms for
                    6 seconds etc... If set to -1 it will play the entire
                    animation, once through. With the Loop flag on (1 ), the animation will
                    loop until interupted by either opcode 0687
                    (clear_actor_task) or another animation.
                
                

                

                To find anims name and in which anim file they are you can
                look in the very good file wrtitten by ceedj : [SAAnims.txt](http://www.pawfectfilms.com/mods/SAAnims.txt" target="_blank), but you can as well think of
                where this animation has been used in the original game, go
                in the mission or the external script in original main.scm it
                is used and search with Sanny Builder the anim you want in
                the mission/external you've seen it.
