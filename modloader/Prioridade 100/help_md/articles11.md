                Mission Coding with Sanny Builder Tutorial

                Part I

                Getting started

                

                

                
              
                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                ** Introduction **
                

                

                Hi, since a long time I wanted to make a tutorial for
                newbies, it won't tell you what to do, it will helps you
                doing what you want to do. It can also be a good tutorial for
                Sanny builder. I tried to make a tutorial for anyone even if
                you don't know anything about programming. You might want
                jump straight to [part II](http://tomworld10.free.fr/GTASA/tutorials/coding/V3/Sannys/articles2.htm" target="_blank), if you think you know enough
                about coding to get started.

                

                

                With Mission coding (or Mission scripting) you can make your
                own missions, your own mods or modificate existing ones (you
                can find many in this [Mission Mods](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showforum=65" target="_blank) and this [Mission Coding](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showforum=49" target="_blank) (and is where you can ask
                questions about coding) . 

                

                

                

                Mission coding is done with the files main.scm and script.img
                in data\script folder of San Andreas. Main.scm is a compiled
                file, so it's made in a language that the computer can
                understand it easily. If you open main.scm with hexadecimal
                editor it looks like that inside :

               **CODE **

D6 00 04 00 19 01 02 45 0E 4D 00 01 FE 3D 87 02 A6 00 02 45 0E
                

                So you need to uncompile it to have it in a human readable
                format, then we will be able to program in it. You don't need
                to do anything on the file script.img, the file is needed, so
                each main.scm will need his own script.img.

                

                

                So to decompile main.scm you need [Sanny
                Builder](http://sannybuilder.com/" target="_blank). There is many other decompiler but if you a
                beginer Sanny will be the best coding solution, because it's
                continuously update, has proper support, is fast, is
                colorfull 
                 !!!!! And the tutorial is made with and for [Sanny
                Builder](http://sannybuilder.com/" target="_blank). 

                Sanny Builder is close to Barton Waterduck's San Andreas
                Mission builder but because the syntax is different I highly
                advise to use [Sanny Builder](http://sannybuilder.com/" target="_blank) but if you want to disobey,
                here it is : [Barton's Waterduck Mission Builder](http://www.kostelecky.com/craig/SAMB033.rar" target="_blank)
                -Craig's version, thanks to him.

                

                

                

                Something very important, to get informations, the Sanny
                Builder's Help, it' full of very useful information and always available (like offline).

                

                

                

                

Launch the executable follow usual installation process. Then go first
to Tools\options (or press F10). In general tab check Show progress,
Show report, Show warning, Quick game loading, Condition check, Ranges
check, Writes opcodes, maybe Replace mission numbers, Insert Original
mission names, Add extra info to SCM. I will explain later why we need
those.

                

                

                

                Like this :

                
                

                Close Sanny Builder and reopen it. 

                

                

                There is many other good tutorials that should help you : [YeTi's SA Coding Tutorial Part One](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=214055&view=findpost&%20%20p=3163789" target="_blank), [YeTi's SA Coding Tutorial Part Two](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=214321&view=findpost&%20%20p=3167813" target="_blank), [Y_less quick tuto](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=232687&view=findpost&%20%20p=3498916" target="_blank), those are for San

                ** 1.
                Main.scm architecture : **
                

                

                

                So now copy original main.scm and script.img to a new coding
                working folder (or anywhere you want : desktop, My docs,
                recycle bin, your mum's docs 
                 ....) you've created and open it (make backups !!!!! like
                doing right away a new folder for original main.scm and
                script.img) by clicking open and selecting SCM File (*.scm).
                You can see the progress bar filling up (That's why we've
                truned on the option "Show progress"). 

                

                

                

                - Define section :

                

                And you will get something like that :

**CODE **

// This file was decompiled using sascm.ini published by Seemann (http://sannybuilder.com/files/SASCM.rar) on 13.10.2007
DEFINE OBJECTS 389
DEFINE OBJECT SANNY BUILDER 3.03     
DEFINE OBJECT INFO                     // Object number -1
DEFINE OBJECT KEYCARD                  // Object number -2
DEFINE OBJECT AD_FLATDOOR              // Object number -3
DEFINE OBJECT KB_BANDIT_U              // Object number -4
etc...

                

                

                As you can see it defines the objects that will be used in
                the main.scm, there is 389 of them like said on top (DEFINE OBJECTS 389). To add an object just go to to last one and add yours.

                

                

                

                Further down (much further down) you can find that :

**CODE **

DEFINE MISSIONS 135
DEFINE MISSION 0 AT @INITIAL
DEFINE MISSION 1 AT @INITIL2
DEFINE MISSION 2 AT @INTRO
DEFINE MISSION 3 AT @NONE
etc...                                      
                

                

                This defines the missions, there is 135 of them like said on
                top (DEFINE MISSIONS 135). If you use Xbox, Playstation 2, or [jarjar 2-player](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=208450&view=findpost&%20%20p=3069233" target="_blank) mod files you can see
                that there is more missions which are 2 player console mission
                but that's another story...

                

                

                

                

**CODE **

DEFINE EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS 78 // Use -1 in order not to compile AAA script
DEFINE SCRIPT PLAYER_PARACHUTE AT @PLCHUTE // 0
DEFINE SCRIPT PARACHUTE AT @PARACH // 1
DEFINE SCRIPT BCESAR2 AT @BCESAR2 // 2
DEFINE SCRIPT BCESAR3 AT @COKEC // 3
DEFINE SCRIPT SLOT_MACHINE AT @BANDIT // 4
etc...
                

                

                This defines the external scripts which are scripts
                (programs) that are triggered when needed, there is 78 of
                them like said on top. That's what handles the Parachute
                (player -PLAYER_PARACHUTE- and non-players -PARACHUTE-), Games at the casino (ROULETTE, VIDPOK -Video Poker-, BLACKJ -Black Jack-, WHEELO -Wheel Of Fortune-, etc...), Shops (AMMU, TATTOO, BARBER, JUNKFUD, CARMOD), and many other thing more or less weird 
				(DEBT, STRIPW, GF_SEX, HOME_BRAINS...) More about those later on.

                

                

                

                Then you get to those 2 lines :
**CODE **

DEFINE UNKNOWN_EMPTY_SEGMENT 0

DEFINE UNKNOWN_THREADS_MEMORY 574
                Which are undocumented and useless for me and you.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                - Main section :

                

                Now you can see something like this :

**CODE **

{$VERSION 3.1.0027}

etc...
                

                

                

                Up to **before** there (use Sanny search tool and search "mission
                0") :
**CODE **

//-------------Mission 0---------------
// Originally: Initial 1

:INITIAL
03A4: name_thread 'INITIAL'
06C8: enable_riot 0
0004: $1515 = 0 
0005: $1500 = 5.0
etc...

                It is called the main part or the main section (and sometimes
                with imprecision named the main thread). In this there is
                many little bit of scripts that for example create the red
                circles which start missions, the thing that handles the
                phone calls (CELLFON and other things), that handles grilfriends, from where
                everything is triggered (started), where many many mods are
                added, and that's where you will start coding. The main
                section is composed of many little threads, but it starts
                with the main thread. And the thread is (and is the only one)
                created by the engine itself, you don't have to use the
                opcode that create threads 004F (create_thread) like everyother ones to ingnite it. Don't worry, a whole
                part will be dedicated to threads later.

                

                In the main part you can only use locals variables (<0@, 1@, 2@, etc...) up to 31@ included, 32@ and 33@ are internals local timers (counts the amount of time
                elapsed, we'll see it later) that you can use too. But any over 33@ will not work in the main part. Sanny won't be happy and
                will tell you that the local var. is out of range (that's why
                we've turned "Range check" option on). You can use any
                globals you want but their number is limited to 16383, it
                should be far enough.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                - Now Mission section :

                

                

                Then after :

**CODE **

//-------------Mission 0---------------
// Originally: Initial 1

:INITIAL
03A4: name_thread 'INITIAL'
06C8: enable_riot 0
0004: $1515 = 0 
0005: $1500 = 5.0
etc...
                

                It's the first mission (which actually ain't a mission
                because it's done during the first milliseconds of a new game
                before the cutscene and doesn't give any mission points).
                This mission actually create parked cars, some weapons pick
                up and other thing.

                

                

                

                

                After will get to the mission 1 (search mission 1) 
**CODE **

//-------------Mission 1---------------
// Originally: Initial 2

:INITIL2
03A4: name_thread 'INITIL2'
0004: $3407 = 25 
0004: $3408 = 100
0004: $3409 = 250
etc...
                

                Same as mission 0 it's not a mission, it only set some
                variables equal to number value, parked some cars again, activate some doors and lifts.

                

                

                Then Mission 2

               **CODE **

//-------------Mission 2---------------
// Originally: Intro

:INTRO
03A4: name_thread 'INTRO'
0050: gosub @INTRO_47 
00D6: if 
0112:   wasted_or_busted // mission only
004D: jump_if_false @INTRO_38 
0050: gosub @INTRO_9715
etc...
                This one is part of the intro cutscene and the mission ends
                when you got to the red circle at CJ's home (Jonhson House in Ganton).

                

                After there is the arcades games (originally: Video game: They crawled
                from uranus; originally: Video game:
                Duality; originally: Video game: Go Go Space
                Monkey; originally: Video game: Let's get
                ready to BUMBLE; originally: Video game: poker) then other thing like pool (originally: Pool), dance (originally: Lowrider (bet and
                dance)) and Zero "hidden/bonus" mission (originally: Beefy Baron) and after those, the "Big smoke" Mission (mission 11) which
                is first mission of the game. 

                

                And then like that up to mission's 134 end.

                If you want to add a mission add after that and define it in
                define mission section. (more later on).

                

                

                

                

                

                

                - External script section (last section)

                

                

                After the last mission you can see all the defined external
                script starting with the first one PLAYER_PARACHUTE:

**CODE **

//-------------External script 0 (PLAYER_PARACHUTE)---------------

:PLCHUTE
03A4: name_thread 'PLCHUTE'
0247: request_model #GUN_PARA

:PLCHUTE_16
etc...
                

                

                and then **CODE **

//-------------External script 1 (PARACHUTE)---------------

:PARACH
03A4: name_thread 'PARACH'
0004: $8275 = 0 
etc...
                

                

                and so on till the 77th external scripts. Many things in
                external scripts, by looking at the name of the external, you
                can often figure out what it is used for.

                

                What's most important for now is the main part.

                

                But still about main.scm architecture, you need to know that
                some things are limited in main.scm look, [here](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=213017&view=findpost&%20%20p=3145932" target="_blank) . As you can see the main size (the
                lenght of all 'main part' threads) is limited to 200 000
                bytes. To know how long the 'main part' is compile and look
                the report it tells you "MAIN size : XXXXXX b." and then the
                biggest mission "Largest Mission : XXXX b." and the Largest
                external script :

                

                That's why we've set on the option "Show report".

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                ** 2. Stripped scm and Opcodes : **
                 

                

				**A.
                Stripped SCM : **
                

                

                

                For your first coding projects you need a main.scm that is
                small (orgininal one is just hudge), and doesn't have thing
                that is useless for scripting. You will gain time compiling
                and not having to wait for the first cutscene. And also
                because of the scm limits, read above. 

                

                So a stripped scm is a main.scm which don't contains any
                mission, any external script, any main threads. Contains
                almost nothing, it just creates the player. 

                

                You can find one in the folder \data\sa where you installed
                Sanny Builder under the name stripped.txt, it looks weird
                because it's written in Sanny Builder classes syntax, I won't tell
                much you about it, find more in Sanny Builder's Help. Not because it isn't good
                because I think it'll be easier to first learn with the
                "opcode method".

                

                You should have something like
                that :

                

**CODE **

{
  use macro (Ctrl+J) "headsa"
  to insert a file header      
}

// put your mods (threads) here

//-------------Mission 0---------------
// put your missions here

//-------------External script 0---------------
// put your external scripts here

                

                

                You probably noticed that there isn't a Define section (DEFINE OBJECTS, DEFINE MISSIONS...)
there is nothing to worry here because there isn't anything that needs
to be defined here. As said in the file if you need an header (define
section) press CTRL+J and select headsa. Like on the pic : 

				Then you'll get what you're missing :
				

**CODE **

DEFINE MISSIONS 0
//DEFINE MISSION {ID} 0 AT {LABEL} @
DEFINE EXTERNAL_SCRIPTS 0 // Use -1 in order not to compile AAA script
//DEFINE SCRIPT {NAME}  AT {LABEL} @
DEFINE UNKNOWN_EMPTY_SEGMENT 0
DEFINE UNKNOWN_THREADS_MEMORY 0

Now you can define your missions and external scripts.

To put mods in this stripped scm you need to put your create threads command (like 004F: create_thread @MYTHREAD) where it says : // put your create_thread commands here. And put your scripts after the MAIN_LOOP where it says // put your mods (threads) here.

                

                

                

**B.
                Opcodes : **
                

                

                

				In begining of most lines there is a 4 digit
                number followed by two dots like 0001:, 087B:, 016A: or 004E:
                like this
                0605:
                 in Sanny Builder . Those are called opcodes !!!!!!! And
                that's why we've set on the "Write opcodes" option.

                

                

                

                

                

                The opcode is the number of the command (action or operation)
                that the game engine will do with the parameters given, all
                opcodes (expect for a few) has a fixed number of
                parameters.

                

                Parameters (also called Params, or just P1, P2, or %p ) are
                the input (numbers, actors, vehicles, text strings or any type
                of variables) of the command. Sanny builder on bottom left
                tells you how much parameters an opcode needs : 

                

                

                

                Here is two example :

                

                **simple**
**CODE **

000A: 3@ += 1 // integer values 

                     
                

- 000A
                     : the opcode which does the operation add to
                  integers
                  
- 3@ and 1
                     : are the parameters, this opcode has 2 parameters.
                
                So this get the local variable (more later) 3@ and adds one to it, like if 3@
                 was equal to 1 now it will be equal to 2 !!!

                

                

                **more complex **
**CODE **

0605: actor $PLAYER_ACTOR perform_animation_sequence "ATM" from_file "PED" 4.0 loop 0 0 0 0 6000 ms

                
                  
- 0605: the opcode of the command 
                  
- $PLAYER_ACTOR, "ATM", "PED", 4.0
                    , 0
                    , 0
                    , 0
                    , 0
                    , 6000
                     : are the parameters, this opcode has 9 parameters.
                
                This command make an existing actor (character) $PLAYER_ACTOR
                 perform the animation "ATM"
                 in the animation file "PED"
                , 4.0
                 is the playback rate of the animation, loop
                0
                 mean it won't do the anim again once finish if the integer
                is set to 1
                 the actor will do the again again and again (loop) until
                it's told to do something else (or destroy, or "free"
                -changing it to any others ped you see in the game, opcode
                01C2), then there is other parameters that we will talk later about them. The last
                one is the time for how long the animation will be executed
                by the engine, act like a wait and will make the engine stop
                executing the code until that time.

                

                

                Now to find the opcode you need you have many places :
                
                  
- Brilliant new "Opcode search tool" in Sanny Builder. In
                    Tools menu, IDE tools, opcode search. Here just write
                    what you're looking for and you'll get a chance to find
                    it. There is a special section in Sanny Builder Help [here](opcode_search.htm) at It tells you the keys to
                    copy opcodes to clipboard (selected opcode = Enter), to
                    sort opcodes, etc... It uses the opcodes.txt that is
                    created by Sanny and that you have to recrate manually if you change sacm.ini.

                    

                  
                  
- Original main.scm uncompiled (the more trustable
                    one most times -pretty good explanation and if used here
                    it DOES work-) Thanks to R* for making the game !!!!!
                    Thanks to Barton Waterduck, Sanny Builder authors, and
                    many others who help decompiling the scm, they should
                    recognize themselves (if they have time reading this).
                    

                    

                  
                  
- [GTA:SA Opcodes](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=194990&view=findpost&%20%20p=2888074" target="_blank) @ [GTAforums](http://www.gtaforums.com/" target="_blank) the place
                    for opcodes and is very good because it contains good
                    description, explainations, and what the value of a
                    parameter do.

                    Thanks to everyone who posted in the topic and to opius
                    for starting it.

                    

                  
                  
- [http://sa-db.webtools4you.net/](http://sa-db.webtools4you.net/" target="_blank) THE
                    interactive database, the best way to use it is to search
                    "nothing" (just clic go) you'll have all opcodes, and
                    then search with your internet browser "find in the
                  page".
                
                But the best way is to refer to all of them !!! 

                

                

                

                The opcode descriptions come from a file called sascm.ini
                which is located in data\sa of Sanny builder installation
                folder. Updating this file will make new descriptions or/and
                change the opcode parameters.
                
                  
- Original Sanny Builder sascm.ini is very good I advise
                    you to keep it for the begining.

                    

                  
                  
- Unified opcode databse from PLPynton [here](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=248182&view=findpost&%20%20p=3750938" target="_blank), or the
                    file [here](http://www.pysniak.com/robert/gtasa/data/sascm.zip" target="_blank).. If you don't want to use the
                    file you can still find some opcodes in the topic. 

                    

                    This opcode "database" has two big advantage, because
                    it's very complete and keeps original parameters order,
                    and a disadvantage is that it use a completly different
                    syntax for description. 
Thanks to PLPynton for creating
                    it.

                    

                    

                  
                  
- Spaceeinstein's sascm.ini [here](http://www.geocities.com/the_coin_page/SASCM.ini.zip" target="_blank). Use the syntax which has always
                    been used. Thanks to him.
                
                To use the files sascm.ini that are given there you have to
                compile all the files you are working on close Sanny builder
                (if open) put the file in folder \data\sa in Sanny Builder
                installation folder (make backup), open Sanny and uncompile
                the files. Evrytime you change sascm.ini you have to do
                that.

                

                

                

                !!!!!!!!!!!! Important !!!!!!!!!!!!

                

                About sascm.ini, don't mess too much with them, choose one
                and stick to it for a while. Everytime you change it you have
                to convert all your files, or compile and uncompile, but you
                have to watch out for opcode parameters, they get sometimes
                mess up in changing sascm.ini and you'll get crashes and bugs
                (and they'll be very hard to find).

				
You
will also have to recreate your opcodes.txt files otherwise completion
with F1 or in the Opcode search. To do this go Tools and "Make
opcodes.txt". My advise is to choose one of those, or keep the one that
is given in Sanny Builder, and don't change it until you have a good
reason to do so.

                The tutorial is made with the sascm.ini given in Sanny
                Builder.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                ** 3. Parameters and variables : **
                

                

                

                There is different types of parameters :
                
                  
- integer (or int), also called whole numbers like 1
                     or -2
                     or 321
                     or any other.

                    

                  
                  
- Floats or floating point values, any decimal
                    number like 1.2
                     or -2372.3845. [More on floating point numbers](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=169526&view=findpost&%20%20p=2352377" target="_blank)

                    

                  
                  
- An actor like CJ (YOU) which is store in the
                    global variable $PLAYER_ACTOR
                    , or Ryder ingame character in $SA_RYDER
                    , or the soldier who watch the gate of the army base in
                    Ryder's mission is store in the local variable @102
                    . The variable gets called an handle when holding
                    (keeping in memory) an actor (or a car), it will be the
                    name of the object next, the handle form where you grab
                    it. 

                    

                  
                  
- A "car" (in coding every vehicle -flying,
                    floating, choppering- is a car), like often the car
                    you're driving $PLAYER_CAR
                    , well like the actors they're stored in local or global
                    variables. Same as actors when stocking a car in a
                    variable it's then called an handle.

                    

                  
                  
- Model identifier like #CHEETAH, #ARMY, #PARACHUTE, the 3D model of a car, an actor, an object. It
                    refers to the dff files that are store in gta3.img. And
                    this model is needed to be loaded (put in memory) to
                    create cars, actors or objects.

                    

                  
                  
- Short text strings (8 bytes long) like 'STRAP_4'
                     or 'MTIME3'
                     which are lettred words that the engine "reads" when
                    passing through and look for the file -or the line a the
                    file- named. They're always 7 character maximum. It
                    refers to file names such as gxt, animation files, IPL
                    files (interiors garage etc...) or threads names, text
                    entries (from gxt file), animations (the animation in the
                    animation file), and many other things. Don't worry much
                    it's just a format for the parameter.

                    

                  
                  
- Long text strings (16 bytes or more long,) like "ATM"
                     or "JEANSDENIM"
                    . It's exactly the same as above it's just a format for
                    the parameter, but this one can handle longer words
                    (Sanny's ReadMe says up to 255 characters) and is used
                    even if the word is shorter than 7 characters. You can
                    find more explanations on strings (both short and long in
                    [this message](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=261006&view=findpost&%20%20p=3940262" target="_blank) from Seemann)

                    

                  
                  
- Labels like MAIN_4059which are used only in jumps (and gosubs) because those
                    opcodes (0002: jump
                    @; 
                    004D: jump_if_false
                     @; 0050: gosub
                    @
                    ; or 004F:
                    create_thread
                     @
                     ) make the engine travels to (jump at) the label told.
                    The label is represented with :
                     before it.

                    

                    example :
**CODE **

:label
0001: wait 0 ms
0002: jump @label

         

                

                

                

Variables are a little piece of memory where you store 
                    something in it. Once you've defined it the engine will remeber it 
                    until it's changed or cleared, even after saving the variable will 
                    still present (saving saves all the variable and reloads it when the 
                    game is loaded). Like when you create an actor you assign it a variable, 
                    which would be like it's name. In those you can put anything 
                    integer, floats, actors, vehicles, text strings (special format).

                

					Then there is two big family of variables 
                    :
- Global variables : which are represented by starting with 
                    $
                    . Globals can be use everywhere in the main.scm. If you
                    set it to something in the main part in mission it will
                    still be accessible and equal to something. Exemples : 
                    $ONMISSION
                    , $PLAYER_ACTOR.

                    

                  
                  
- Local variables : Locals are represented by an @
                     at the end like 1@
                    , 2@
                    . Each thread ( created by 004F) has his own set of
                    locals, like 0@
                     in :thread_A
                     isn't the same as 0@
                     in :thread_B. In main part you cannot use over 33@
                     (which is a local timer see downer for more details).
                    But in mission you can use up to 1024@
                     .
                
                Locals timers : 32@
                 and 33@
                , are internal locals timers, they count the number of
                milliseconds that have elapsed. Like if you set it to 0 ,
                wait 10 seconds and look how much 32@
                 or 33@
                 worth you'll find 10 000. if you set it to 1 000 and wait 5
                second before looking it will then be equal to 6 000 ms. 

                

                Short and long text strings : text strings are stored in
                special format of variables. Text string a highlighted in red
                in Sanny. There is 4 kind of text variables 2 for short (8
                bytes, 'STRING'
                ) strings, 2 for long strings (16 bytes, "LONGSTRING"
                ) : 

                

                For short strings : 

                

                - a global text string like : s$1169 or s$ACTOR_SPEECH_GXT_REFERENCE
                 which can always be accessible like other globals.

                

                - a local text string like : 170@s
                 or 5@s
                 which are accessible only in their own thread.

                

                

                For long strings : 

                

                - a global text string : v$1225 or v$MYLONGSTRING
                , same as short string but for long ones...

                

                - a local long string : 28@v
                , same as short ones...

                

                

                BUT watch out, for exemple0@s
                 replace 0@
                 if existing and vice versa, it is the same variable but
                they're just in a different format.

                

                

                And I want to remind (or tell) you that a integer and a float
                are different to game engine ( 1
                 isn't the same as 1.0
                 !!!!!). If the opcode needs a float and you give it a int
                (and vice versa) the game WILL crash. 

                You can convert an integer to a float with opcode 008D. And
                convert a float to an integer with 008C.

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                

                ** 4. Threads and labels : **
                

                

                A thread is a "stand alone" (something that needs nothing but
                itself) piece of code. It's like a program by itself (like an
                opened window on your operating system -like Microsoft
                Windows-). So to use (play ingame with) your future mods
                (programs, windows) you'll need to create a new one. What you
                do with 004F like : 

                **CODE **

004F: create_thread @MYTHREAD
                

                

                Threads are like fire in a world with matches (ligther,
                silex, well you cannot "make" fire you need to ingnite it
                from another fire -like the Olympic Flame never switched off
                between 2 olympic games). You must create a new one from an
                existing one. As I said before the main thread is created by
                the engine itself. The 'MAIN' thread will 
                lite your fire. So if it's the only existing thread (like in
                a stripped main.scm) you'll need to create your thread in the
                main thread BEFORE it gets switched off by (before this line)
                : 

                **CODE **

004E: end_thread
                

                

                

                If using a bigger file (like orignal main.scm) just create it
                where there is many others create_thread
                 (004F) like this :

                

                

                

                

                

                Don't worry about "00D7:
                create_thread_with_wasted_busted_check " because their real
                use is actually unknown yet. Use 004F, there is better ways
                to check if player is wasted or busted (like conditional
                opcode 0112). As Seeman tells us later in the topic 004f
                creates a thread with 0 to 32 extra-parameters, and 00d7
                creates a thread with 0 extra-parameters. So don't worry at
                all about 00d7 because 004f does the same and as more
                functionalities. ([Seemann's message](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=261006&view=findpost&%20%20p=3937655" target="_blank))

                

                

                

                Like I said before in each single thread you've create you
                have for each thread it's very own set of locals from 0@ to
                33@ (32@ and 33@ being local timers). They're pretty usefull
                because not sucking up memory. 

                

                

                

                

                A label is a little piece of thread like :MAIN_4059. Think now the thread as a book (no more fire 
                 ) and labels would be pages of this book. Then you can
                easily understand that a jump (or jump_if_false, or gosub) to
                a certain label would be like a report to a certain page. 

                

                

                I made an animated example for you to see how the game engine
                travels through the labels :

                

                

                The red line represent the code (the engine is called
                sometimes simply the code, like the code reader) going
                through labels.

                

                As you can see the thread label
                 is created from another thread. You can see the code
                "seperating" in two one going to just created thread label
                 one keeps doing the thread it use to do, and it gets ended
                (but could be continuing to do things if you don't end it).
                

                It goes through :label to :label_100. In :label_100 you can see there is an "if" with a condition in it,
                followed by a jump_if_false, this means that if $PLAYER_ACTOR
                 is near position in 3 dimension 2498.0 -1711.0 1015.0
                 the code can pass through and jump to :label_200.

                So the code keeps looping in :label_100 until the condition is satisfied.

                Then jumps to :label_200 without passing through :label_150, going straight to :label_200. Does what it needs to do in :label_200 (which is to put the 3D coordinates of actor $PLAYER_ACTOR
                 into variables $X_COORD $Y_COORD $Z_COORD).
				Then jumps to :label_150, waits 1minute and jump back :label_100 and check again if player's near the point. And will
                do all over again and again and again. You don't have to end
                a thread if you don't need to, it can just keep check
                something to start. Don't forget you got to do something with
                your thread, keep it running or end it but don't let it free.
                

                

                !!!!!!! Notice the wait (0001: wait 0 ms), because it's
                compulsory !!!!!!!!!!!!!

                When looping you have to add a wait so the engine doesn't get
                itself stucked in it, and it won't even crash then it will
                just simply freeze. The only way to recover from it is to
                force resolution change (sometimes just impossible to do, and
                some laptops have a combo key) and end GTA:SA with task
                manager. 

                

                If you don't really know if you should add a wait or not just
                add "wait 0 ms", because most times you will not see the
                difference at all, and mostly anything under 500 ms you don't
                notice it. 

                

                

				                

                
                

                
                

                
                

				
				
			** 5. "If"s and conditional opcodes : **
                

                

                What's called an "if" is a code strucutre that checks if
                something is happening. Like :

                if 

                I die 

                if not then --> I will finish my mods

                --> you give all my unfinished mods to the GTA
                community

                

                

                In Sanny Builder it would look like 

                

                

                The engine will travel straight through if the something
                checked happens but jump to another label if it doesn't
                happend (004D: jump_if_false @ ). The something (which could
                or not happend) of the if is called a condition, for them you
                use conditionals opcode !!!!!!! And you can put up to seven
                conditions in one if !!!!!!! (I know you're like "Yes I'm so
                happy, that's really change my life !!!!!!...." but... )

                

                

                

                Then there is two kind of multiple conditions ifs :

                

                When you have multiple conditions you might want to have
                all conditions true (happens) or at least one of
                them  true.
                
                  
- if and is when you want all the conditons
                    to be true for passing through like :

                     

                    So here you can see that if all those external scripts
                    are loaded it goes through but then if any of them isn't
                    it will jump to label :INTMAN_1088. You can think it as if this
                    and this and this is OK then go throught if
                    not jump because it's false.

                    

                    

                  
                  
- if or is when you only need one of those
                    conditions to be go through like :

                    

                    Here it's if any of these door is open keep going but if
                    not jump to :MAIN_4336. You can think it as if this or this
                    or this or happens go througt but if there
                    isn't any that is true jump because it's false.
                
                And and or are called logic operators.

                

                Notice how it wouldn't make sens to add an or or an
                and in a single condition if. Only one condition, you
                just cannot use them, only one element !!!!! And sanny
                builder won't like it neither it will tell you "hey don't do
                that".

                

                On the other hand don't forget to put an or or an
                and to your multiples conditions ifs, becasue sanny
                won't say anything, the game might not crash, but I'm sure it
                won't work properly, either and or or, but you
                need to put something in multiple conditions ifs.

                

                

                

                

                You can negate all conditional opcodes. Negate is like adding
                a not in the conditons. If actor **not** dead, or if actor
                not driving. Then it means that to pass through it, the
                condition needs to return false (don't happend). You can
                negate conditional opcodes in mutlpiple conditions ifs too.
                To negate a conditional opcode you have to put a 8 at the
                first digit instead of 0, like :

                

                not negated

                

                

                

                negated

                

                You don't have to write not the compiler (sanny) will not look at it, and it will
                write it when re-uncompiling. But you still can write not if you want, it makes it clearer and easier to work
                with. But you really HAVE TO write the 8 in the opcode.

                

                When you negate all conditions a 'multiple conditions if',
                you have to change around the logic operator.

                

                

                

                

                

                Those two do the same :
                
                  
- the first one checks if player is agressive or
                    aiming at actor 14@
                     or aiming at actor 15@
                     or aiming at actor 16@
                     or aiming at actor 17@
                    , if any of those is true the code passes through and
                    jump to labelz.
				  
- the second one check if player is not agressive and 
                    not aiming at actor 14@
                     and not aiming at actor 15@
                     and not aiming at actor 16@
                     and not aiming at actor 17@
                    , if any of those is false (if player do aims) the code
                    will jump because it's false to labelz.
					
					Sometimes when look for some nice mods you might find :

**CODE **

00D6: if 0	

or

**CODE **

00D6: if 5

or

**CODE **

00D6: if 21

or

**CODE **

00D6: if 25

					
					

Don't worry 
                    it's the same, compile, then decompile it and you'll have the 
                    logic operator written. And that's why we've enable 
                    "Conditions check", so we can use and & or 
                    and Sanny writes them when decompiling.

if 0 = if

if x = if and

if 2x = if or

Read [Conditions in Sanny Builder's Help](conditions.htm) or/and [here](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=134970&view=findpost&%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20p=2083394" target="_blank) (It's for Vice City but is the 
                    same, just ignore "?") for more explanations.
					

					

					You 
                    might want to do high-level conditions construction, read [Conditions in Sanny Builder's Help](conditions.htm), it explains it pretty well. Low level contructions can be good 
                    for now, and you can make high level with low level anyway. 
					

					

					

					

					BUT remember well when doing "if"s, add waits 
                    where you know the code is going to loop back. And a wait 0 is never a 
                    problem because it actually wait for 0 milisecond which is pretty short 
                    !!!!!!! but it will let time to the engine 
                    doing other things. Relook at the animated exemple for labels to 
                    understand where you'll absolutly need wait.
					

					

					

					

					

					

					

					

					

					

					

					

					

					

                    ** 6. Request models, load them, create, then release them to free memory : **
                    

                    

                    When creating actor (with opcode 009A), car (with op
                    00A5), object (with op 0107), give weapon to an actor you
                    have to request the dff model before and load it, and
                    check that is it loaded for real !!!!!!

                    

                    Like :

                    Look how I first request the models (with 0247:
                    request_model) then load them (with 038B:
                    load_requested_models). Then checks if all models
                    requested are available to use (with 0248). If any of
                    them is load jumps back to top and re-request and reload
                    them. If they all are then create the actor, the weapons
                    and the object. You can see in the comment (after //)
                    that 01B2 need the weapon model to be load before using
                    it (for weapons numbers look in help [here](SCMHELPGTASA14.htm) or at very good 
					[Generic SA SCM Documentaion](http://www.gtaforums.com/index.php?showtopic=205020&view=findpost&%20%20p=3013775" target="_blank).

                    

                    

                    Once you've finished doing what you need to with thoses
                    (they're all dead, player is too far away, don't want
                    them here, etc...) transform them into usuals peds and
                    cars (like all the peds and cars you see in-game) or
                    destroy them (the object must be destroyed) :

                    

                   **CODE **

0108: destroy_object 9@ 
01C3: remove_references_to_car 1@ // Like turning a car into any random car 
01C3: remove_references_to_car 0@ // Like turning a car into any random car 
01C2: remove_references_to_actor 11@ // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian 
01C2: remove_references_to_actor 14@ // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian 
01C2: remove_references_to_actor 15@ // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian 
01C2: remove_references_to_actor 16@ // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian 
01C2: remove_references_to_actor 17@ // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian 
01C2: remove_references_to_actor 18@ // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian 
01C2: remove_references_to_actor 19@ // Like turning an actor into a random pedestrian 
 
                    

                    

                    or **CODE **

0108: destroy_object 9@ 
00A6: destroy_car 0@ 
00A6: destroy_car 1@ 
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 11@ 
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 14@ 
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 15@ 
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 16@
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 17@
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 18@ 
009B: destroy_actor_instantly 19@
                    

                    

                    Don't apply those (01C2, 01C3, 0108, 00A6, 009B, etc...)
                    to an actor, or a car that doesn't exist (or when the
                    handle that should hold it -like 0@, $car, etc...-
                    doesn't hold it), because the game will badly crash!!!!!!
                    

                    

                    Once you got rid of actors/cars/objects (So when you
                    finished using them, and after you have delete them, and
                    only after that), you can release the models you've used
                    because you will no longer need them.

                    

**CODE **

0249: release_model #WMYBOUN 
0249: release_model #BMYBOUN 
0249: release_model #HFYBE   
0249: release_model #POLICE_BARRIER
0249: release_model #DESERT_EAGLE
0249: release_model #MP5LNG 
0249: release_model #CHEETAH 
0249: release_model #TURISMO
                    

                    

                    

                    You actualy could have release those models earlier, you don't need them to be loaded **after**
you have created the game object (object, actor or vehicle). But I
advise you for a start to release the model only at the end of your
script/mission when you sure won't need it anymore. It will prevent you
from a few return to desktop.

                    

                    

                    

                    

                 
                    ** Conclusion **
                     

                    

                    

                    Well, this part was mostly informations, there isn't much
                    to do. But now you know that an opcode is a 4 digit number
                    that do things in the game depending on the parameters you gave it. You know
                    the different types of parameters, what's a local
                    variable and what's a global one. Creating, naming and ending threads, and many other things
                    that you need to know to keep going. Now we speak the
                    same "language" we can get to real coding.

                    Let's get to [part II](articles2.htm)...
